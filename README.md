First we will introduce Theoretical concepts on data representation and issue to be considered. During the hands on sessions, you will learn how to use the python for visual data analysis. 

The target audience are IDS@UM staff who are interested in data science with enthusiasm on Reproducible Science at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/).

## Environment setup

1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms)
3. run `python run_docker_jupyter.py`
